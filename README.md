# LLSDA--LightningLocationSystemDataAnalyzer
## Brief Introduction
LLSDA(Lightning Location System Data Analyzer) is an cross platform class library for lightning location system using C# following .NET Standard 2.0 . It is the necessary part of all lightning time and spatial distribution analysis software.

## Introduction
Lightning is a violent and sudden electrostatic discharge where two electrically charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves, usually during a thunderstorm.

Lightning location meter, also known as lightning monitoring location meter, refers to the use of the sound, light, electromagnetic characteristics of the lightning return stroke radiation to telemetry lightning return stroke discharge parameters of an automatic weather detection equipment, it can detect the occurrence of lightning time, location, intensity, polarity, etc..People have been devoted to the research of lightning detection and early detection and prediction techniques and methods of thunderstorm disaster.

Lightning location system data analyzer, is basic data analysis library. The data development based on lightning location system will depend on the basic class library development of lightning location system.In order to prevent duplication of efforts, improve development efficiency, and make personal contributions to the open source community and lightning protection industry. I contribute this library to open source community.

Glad you like it.
